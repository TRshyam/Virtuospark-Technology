        <h1>Sections of this Agreement:</h1>
        <p>This Agreement comprises the "<b>General Terms</b>" and, if applicable, the "<b>Service Specific Terms</b>". In case of a conflict, the Service Specific Terms take precedence.</p>
        <h1>Acceptance of the Agreement:</h1>
        <p>To accept this Agreement, you must be of legal age. By using our Services, you signify your agreement to the General Terms. If you disagree with the General Terms or any Service Specific Terms, refrain from using the corresponding Service.</p>
        <h1>Description of Service:</h1>
        <p>VirtuoSpark offers an extensive array of cloud software and applications for businesses, including offline and mobile applications ("<b>Services</b>"). These can be used for personal or business purposes, subject to the terms herein. Our commitment is to provide versatile tools that cater to your diverse needs in the realm of business productivity and collaboration.</p>
        <h1>Beta Service:</h1>
        <p>As part of our commitment to innovation, we may introduce certain Services as closed or open beta services for testing. Users are not obligated to subscribe to paid Services based on their use of Beta Services. This ensures that you have the opportunity to explore and evaluate cutting-edge features before they become commercially available.</p>
        <h1>Free Trial:</h1>
        <p>Upon registering for a free trial, VirtuoSpark provides Services without charge for a limited period. Data entered during the trial may be lost unless a paid subscription is initiated or data is exported before the trial ends. This trial period allows you to experience the full spectrum of our Services with no upfront financial commitment.</p>
        <h1>User Sign-up Obligations</h1>
        <p>To ensure a seamless and secure user experience, VirtuoSpark places importance on the accuracy of user information during sign-up. For organizational users, utilizing corporate contact details is recommended. This not only enhances the authenticity of user accounts but also facilitates efficient communication. We encourage organizations to designate competent individuals as administrators, responsible for configuring services according to specific requirements. The role of administrators is pivotal in managing end-users within the organizational account. Vigilance in maintaining confidentiality and promptly updating information demonstrates a commitment to the integrity and security of user accounts, fostering a trustworthy digital environment for collaborative endeavors.</p>
        <h1>Restrictions on Use:</h1>
        <p>In addition to the overarching terms of this Agreement, users shall refrain from transferring, sharing licenses, disassembling the Services, or engaging in activities harmful to VirtuoSpark's systems. This is to ensure the integrity and security of our Services.</p>
        <h1>Spamming and Illegal Activities:</h1>
        <p>Users are solely responsible for the content transmitted. Services should not be used for illegal, defamatory, or spam purposes. VirtuoSpark reserves the right to terminate accounts engaging in unauthorized or illegal activities. By maintaining a secure environment, we strive to foster responsible and ethical use of our Services.</p>
        <h1>Third-Party Applications:</h1>
        <p>Integration with third-party applications is subject to their terms. VirtuoSpark may suspend, restrict, or remove access to Third Party Applications at its discretion. This allows us to uphold the quality and compatibility of our Services with external applications.</p>
        <h1>Fees and Payments:</h1>
        <p>Subscription fees apply to various plans, providing flexibility based on your business needs. Users are responsible for Taxes, and refunds are subject to VirtuoSpark's Refund Policy. This transparent fee structure ensures clarity and fairness in our billing practices.</p>
        <h1>Organization Accounts and Administrators:</h1>

        <h1>Complaints:</h1>
        <p>Complaints about user activities will be forwarded, and users must respond within 10 days. Failure to respond may lead to disclosure of user information. This process ensures a fair and accountable resolution to any complaints received.</p>
        <h1>Inactive User Accounts Policy:</h1>
        <p>Inactive accounts may be terminated after 120 days. Users will receive prior notice and an option to back up data. This policy aims to maintain a streamlined user base, ensuring active participation and engagement within our Services.</p>
        <h1>Data Ownership:</h1>
        <p>Users own their created content. VirtuoSpark is granted permission to access, store, and transmit content for service provision. This approach reinforces our commitment to respecting the rights and ownership of user-generated content.</p>
        <h1>Hosting Location:</h1>
        <p>Accounts may be migrated based on region/country mapping. Users must not mask their IP address at sign-up. This ensures accurate mapping of user accounts to the appropriate cloud facility, maintaining data integrity and regulatory compliance.</p>
        <h1>User Generated Content:</h1>
        <p>Users are responsible for publicly shared content. VirtuoSpark may block or remove content violating third-party rights. This proactive approach safeguards against potential legal issues and promotes responsible content sharing.</p>
